# FlightService
This is the repository for my FlightService App. By using my application, users should be able to create different passengers, flights, edit/delete each and 
add a passenger to a flight which will then create a ticket. From the ticket page, users should be able to edit, delete and add a new ticket.

This project was split up into separate parts, one for the front and one for the back end.
The backend component, FlightServiceAPI should be run in Visual Studio.
The frontend component, FlightServiceWeb should be run in Visual Studio Code using the command "NPM Start" 
Once this is done, the program should boot up and the user should be on the home page and see "Welcome to Minty Fresh Airlines!"
If there is an issue, ensure that FlightServiceWeb knows the correct port FlightServiceAPI is using.
